          <p>My first job:</p>
          <p>In 2019 I started my first job at Media Markt in sales, I started as a cassier. After 2 months i changed to the real deal. I started selling washing machine, fridges etc... I did a good job, and got asked if I wanted to go for a bigger challenge. The challenge was selling pc's and phones and every accesory that you can imagine. I liked that more because of my past with informatics. I also did a quite good job so i got promoted to do provider services. So I did Proximus, Orange and Scarlet.</p>

          <p>My new job:</p>
          <p>After almost 4 years working in Media Markt it was time for a new challenge, I am going to be a HR Recruiter on 7 Novembre for Ago Jobs HR. In the last year i was studying HTML and CSS because i wanted to make sites likes this and maybe in the future for clients. That's why my department in Ago is only for IT'ers. I am really excited and hope that it will be fun!</p>
